# PwniTM
MiTM tool for HTTP pages using Metasploit and mitmproxy

USAGE:

First of all, locate the path of mitmproxy on your O.S. and go to pwnitm file, and change the path of mitmproxy.

In the injector file, look for the iframe variable and change the IP address for yours

Once you start the tool, wait for metasploit to load all the exploits (20). 

Once the modules have been loaded, have fun :D
